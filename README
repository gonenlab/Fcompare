** Programs to compare structure factors for a variety of wonky file formats **

Each program has a section of varibles that the user has to edit before running.



* cif files: from the pdb and our home source manually remove any header information

* MTZdump files:  To prepare one of these files from a MTZ run this command from the unix shell:
            
            phenix.mtz.dump -f s -c [mtz_filename] > [output_filename]

The column that contains the structure factors seems to be different every time so programs that use them have a variable that defines which column contains the structure factor.
    
* microED data from matt's programs: the output from any of Matt's merging programs which is tab delineated in the following format:

    h k l F sigF I sigI
    
    
Each program outputs a csv file with each spot that appears in both input files, the F value from each and the ratio of the two.
ENJOY!
